Uniformity:
All objects will be in the same style, and I will be using proper naming conventions to make sure they don’t get confusing.

Scope:
I don’t think I’ve over-scoped, all of my assets are relatively small so I’m not worried about completing them, I just need to make sure they all get done before the deadline.
I think that combining these objects and wall textures will bring the environment to life and make it fitting for a final project.

Schedule:
Deadlines for models of the assets are next to them in the list.
I will texture them as I add them to the unity project.

Goal:
My goal for the project is to hopefully have a cool portfolio piece that looks okay and presentable to future employers. I also feel I have a cool idea and I want to bring it to life!
